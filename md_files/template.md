# SHORT AND CLEAR TITLE GOES HERE

## What is this snippet for?
<!-- What: <each thing should have a brief rundown of what it does. Maybe 2-4 sentences tops. 
example: Simple walkthrough and example code (python) to create a "template" surface pscalar, then to populate the Gordon 333 surpace parcels with arbirary values. 
(good for visualization of any metric or value you are computing using parcels.)
-->
WALKTHROUGH TEXT HERE

## Why do we need this?
<!-- Why: Some brief background on the use case. This can be however long, but keep it short. 
example: For one project I was identifying parcels of interest. To show this across a group of subjects, I needed to essentially place a number on each parcel, which represented how many times that parcel was a parcel of interest across all subjects in my group. This example code allows you to place arbitrary values (for me this was the count of how many times the parcel was chosen) on any parcel, which you can then bring into workbench viewer and make a nice figure including a color map for your results, etc.
