# Handbook for the Recently HCP'd
Snippets of code, examples, and simple walkthroughs to help grad students/new users complete basic tasks with workbench command and common HCP pipeline output files. 

### Background: 
Working with HCP files has been an adventure. There are many resouces out there and the workbench commands are very powerful, however, completing many tasks I would simply and quickly do using fsl commands on volume files weren't as straight forward with surface/HCP files. I was constantly searching for brief and simple examples or step-by-step instructions for the tasks I was trying to complete...but was unable to find them. 

This repository is meant to be a living resource for people in my position. Those searching for simple step-by-step instructions and examples commands or code to build upon. Hopefully, it will lessen the struggle for grad students and new workbench and HCP users.
